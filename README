AnkiMobile-canvas extends the AnkiMobile iPhone app by adding support for a
drawing scratchpad primarily for kanji review.

Using this currently requires a bit of manual labor. Future versions will
include a plugin or something similarly foolproof.

First, include the following in the card templates where you want a canvas:

    <div id="canvas" />

Then run the following Perl script to import the necessary CSS and JavaScript
into your deck.

    perl import-canvas.pl PATHTODECK

Finally sync to your iDevice, making sure that at least some changes were
synced. deckVars are not synced by default.
