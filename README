AnkiMobile-canvas extends the AnkiMobile iPhone app by adding support for a
drawing scratchpad primarily for kanji review.

The recommended way to install this is using Damien Elmes's "Embed scratchpad
for AnkiMobile" plugin available through Anki's "Download Shared Plugin"
functionality.

If for some reason you want to install it manually, here's how.

First, include the following in the card templates where you want a canvas:

    <div id="canvas" />

Then run the following Perl script to import the necessary CSS and JavaScript
into your deck.

    perl import-canvas.pl PATHTODECK

Finally sync to your iDevice, making sure that at least some changes were
synced. deckVars are not synced by default.
